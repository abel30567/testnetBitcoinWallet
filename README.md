# Bitcoin Testnet Wallet

<img src="https://github.com/abel30567/testnetBitcoinWallet/blob/master/bitwallaScreen.png" />

This is a Bitcoin testnet wallet I made using ReactJS, NodeJS, Express.js and bitcore-insight.

I wanted to show others how they could use `bitcore-insight` to create Bitcoin transactions so I made a small wallet web app.

## Scripts

Start the app
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abel30567/testnetBitcoinWallet.git
    cd testnetBitcoinWallet
    npm install
    node server.js
    npm start
```

### Capabilities

If you are a Javascript developer and want to mess around with testnet transacions I suggest checking out this app. I added the Radium package that allows pseudo-classes to be changed with inline JS styles.

This is not a responsive web app and is meant for testing purposes.
